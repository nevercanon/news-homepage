## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

I will include screenshots in my GitHub repository.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This felt a little more challenging than most projects have been lately, which was nice. However, it wasn't too difficult. I wasn't looking forward to using Grid, but this was the first time I didn't have a lot of trouble with it. That was a relief, and hopefully means that I'm improving.

I had a lot of trouble with the mobile navigation menu. Mainly with the darkening effect. I got it to work finally, but when I changed its background color to transparent for the desktop layout, it messed with the hover effects. I ended up needing to create a desktop navigation and a mobile navigation and just use them for their corresponding layouts. I was unaware that it would have this effect, so I feel like that was a good learning experience.

I tried using ul and ol for this in the article lists, and I hope that was the right thing to do. It did feel really complicated, but I want to improve my semantics and accessibility.

### Continued development

I'm currently just planning on doing more of the Junior level projects. I might do all of them to get enough practice. I think I need more Grid practice, and I always need more JavaScript practice.
